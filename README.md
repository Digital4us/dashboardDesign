# dashboardDesign
This simple dashboard design is easy to use and integrates well with multiple frameworks like AngularJS.

## What's Available
Here is a breakdown of the views that are currently available:
 - `index.html` displays an empty page with the core FlatUI functionality working and available.
 - `navbar.html` displays an empty page with a navigational bar at the top.
 - `login.html` displays a login form. It asks the user for a username and password, and has an option if the user forget their password as well.
 - `dashboard.html` displays the initial screen one gets to when they login. It displays a list of all th 'clients' in the system.
 - `clients.html` displays an individual 'client' page and some placeholder information that can be stored on this page.
 - `panels.html` is another client display page with a different orientation. Ideally different panels can be clicked on and slide down to show additional information when needed
 Note: all pages except for the `index.html` page have the navigational bar at the top.

## Shout outs to:
 - [FlatUI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) which is built as a theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

## Inspiration
I'm working on a project that requires the use of a dashboard. While the functionality and use-case is different, many of the core elements (login form, dashboard display, client display, navbar) are still the same. The project I'm working on uses AngularJS as a framework, and this theme structure worked very well with the Angular integration.
